# Agriculture Food Supply Chain with Post-Harvest Loss Using Blockchain

## 📊 Description
This project introduces a blockchain-based solution for managing the **Agriculture Food Supply Chain**, focusing on reducing post-harvest losses. By leveraging the transparency and security of the blockchain, farmers, distributors, and consumers can interact in a secure and traceable manner.

## 🌟 Features
- 👨‍🌾 **Farmer Registration:** Farmers can securely register on the blockchain network.
- 🛠️ **Product Addition:** Farmers can add product details (name, quantity, price) to the system.
- 💰 **Product Sales:** Transparent and secure transactions between farmers, distributors, and consumers.
- 📊 **Loss Recording:** Post-harvest losses can be recorded for accurate inventory tracking.
- 🛠️ **Traceability:** Consumers can trace the product's origin and supply journey via batch numbers.

## 👨‍💻 Technology Stack
- ⚖️ **Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum  
- 🛠️ **Smart Contracts:** Solidity  
- 📝 **Frontend Integration:** Web3.js and MetaMask  

## 🚀 Deployment
- 🛠️ The system is deployed on the **Ethereum blockchain** using **Geth**.
- 💻 The frontend connects to the Geth node to interact with deployed smart contracts.
